# Repository Guidelines

This repository explores the selfâ€‘regulating charge routing concept. Use the following guidelines when contributing:

- Place all unvalidated experiments and prototypes under `/_sep/testbed/`.
- Document research notes in the `docs/` directory.
- Monitor for actual code execution paths or build outputs. Skip formatting-only commits.
- If you modify logic or function bodies, run available tests and linters. Currently there are no automated tests; perform basic shell syntax checks on scripts when changed.
- Keep commit messages concise.
