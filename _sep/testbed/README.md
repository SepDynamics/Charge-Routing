# Charge Routing Testbed

This folder contains early-stage experiments exploring recursive spiral geometries and dielectric fluids.
Each script should include usage instructions and note any observations.

Scripts:

- `spiral_demo.py` – generates coordinates for a simple square spiral.
- `spiral_network.py` – solves a resistor-network model of the spiral
  with a midpoint cross-link.
- `spiral_sweep.py` – sweeps over turn counts and reports potential
  uniformity with and without the midpoint cross connection.
- `spiral_stats.py` – computes average uniformity from the sweep
  results.
