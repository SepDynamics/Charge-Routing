# Documentation

This folder collects research notes and experimental plans related to the self-regulating charge routing project.

- `experimental_framework.md` — outlines proposed simulation and physical tests.
- `analysis_notes.md` — brief exploration of resistor-network modeling.
- `../_sep/testbed` — contains prototype scripts and experiments
  (including parameter sweeps with `spiral_sweep.py`).

Use this directory to record results and hypotheses as development progresses.
