# Documentation Guidelines

- Use this directory for research notes, experiment results, and theoretical analysis.
- Keep entries concise and reference script names when discussing prototypes.
- Summaries of unvalidated experiments should link to the relevant files under `/_sep/testbed/`.
- Avoid speculative claims without supporting data; mark assumptions clearly.
